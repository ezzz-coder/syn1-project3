                <p>
                    PM2.5 consists of tiny particles (smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) that can deeply
                    penetrate the respiratory system and enter the bloodstream.
                    Exposure can cause lung inflammation, bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, and decreased lung function.
                    Long-term exposure increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer,
                    cardiovascular diseases (heart attacks, strokes), and premature death.

                <p>
                    PM2.5 can alter cloud formation and precipitation patterns, impacting local weather.
                    Some PM2.5 particles, like black carbon (soot), absorb sunlight and contribute to warming,
                    accelerating ice melt in polar regions.
                    Other PM2.5 components, such as sulfates and nitrates, reflect sunlight and can have a temporary
                    cooling effect.
                    Overall, PM2.5 impacts climate in complex ways, depending on its composition and location.

                <h2>Health Effects</h2>
                <p>
                    Ozone is a highly reactive gas that damages lung tissue and reduces lung function.
                    Short-term exposure causes throat irritation, coughing, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing.
                    Long-term exposure increases the risk of chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD.
                    Ozone can also increase susceptibility to lung infections and worsen pre-existing heart conditions.

                <h2>Climate Impacts</h2>
                <p>
                    Ozone is a short-lived greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global
                    warming.
                    Unlike CO₂, which remains in the atmosphere for centuries, ozone has a shorter lifespan but a strong
                    warming potential.
                    It also harms vegetation and reduces crop yields, negatively impacting food security.
                    Ozone exposure can damage forests, leading to ecosystem disruptions.

                <p>
                    NO₂ is a toxic gas that primarily affects the respiratory system.
                    Short-term exposure can cause throat irritation, coughing, and reduced lung function.
                    Long-term exposure is linked to chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic
                    obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
                    NO₂ increases susceptibility to lung infections by weakening the immune system's defenses.

            <div class="climate">
                <h2>Climate Impacts</h2>
                <p>
                    NO₂ is a precursor to ground-level ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), both of which
                    contribute to air pollution and climate change.
                    It plays a role in the formation of acid rain, which harms forests, aquatic life, and
                    infrastructure.
                    NO₂ contributes to haze and smog, reducing visibility and worsening urban air quality.
                    While NO₂ itself is not a major greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N₂O), another nitrogen oxide, is a
                    potent greenhouse gas with 300 times the warming potential of CO₂.

                <p>
                    SO₂ is a highly irritating gas that affects the respiratory system, causing wheezing, shortness of
                    breath, and throat irritation.
                    It triggers asthma attacks and increases the risk of lung infections.
                    SO₂ exposure can lead to inflammation of the airways, bronchitis, and decreased lung function.
                    Long-term exposure contributes to chronic respiratory diseases and heart conditions.

                <p>
                    SO₂ reacts in the atmosphere to form sulfate aerosols, which reflect sunlight and cool the Earth's
                    surface.
                    However, sulfate aerosols also contribute to acid rain, which damages forests, harms aquatic life,
                    and degrades buildings and infrastructure.
                    SO₂ emissions from coal burning can lead to severe regional air pollution issues, such as smog and
                    haze.

                <p>
                    CO is a colorless, odorless gas that binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, reducing the blood's
                    ability to carry oxygen.
                    Low-level exposure can cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, and confusion.
                    High exposure levels can lead to loss of consciousness, organ damage, and death (carbon monoxide
                    poisoning).
                    Chronic exposure increases the risk of heart diseases and neurological damage.

                    CO is not a direct greenhouse gas, but it indirectly contributes to global warming by reacting with
                    hydroxyl radicals (OH), reducing their ability to break down methane (a potent greenhouse gas).
                    Also, Elevated CO levels lead to the formation of ground-level ozone, worsening air pollution.
